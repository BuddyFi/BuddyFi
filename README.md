# BuddyFi

Imagine if Tinder and Devfolio had a Web3 baby. That’s **BuddyFi** — a Solana-powered platform that helps developers match with the perfect teammates for hackathons. Whether you’re a backend wizard, a frontend artist, or a full-stack force, BuddyFi is here to help you vibe with your next build buddy.

Think of it as "team Tinder for devs" — matching based on skills, interests, availability, and hackathon goals. All profiles are on-chain and tamper-proof. Built with Solana + Next.js + Arweave/IPFS/Piniata.
